The data cover 19 types of fleets and over 200 types of self-propelled equipment datasets, representing the potential to prepare thousands of unit-process datasets by varying the operating and model years, applicable power ranges, and operating temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe key information source used for datasets development is the documentation and supporting data developed for the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) NONROAD2008a model. In addition to the data and mathematical relationships described in the NONROAD documentation, data from a range of sources are used to add lubricant use and management estimates; add equipment production and storage, spare parts production, and equipment retirement estimates; estimate specific air emissions and groupings of air emissions; and add variability and uncertainty estimates.","version":"00.00.000","url":"dx.doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1255848","textReference":"Cooper et. al.
